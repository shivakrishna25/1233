Experiment 1: Demonstrate Network packet analysis using
WireShark tool.
1. Aim: Study of packet sniffer tool Wireshark
2. Objectives: Identify different packets moving in/out of network using packet sniffer for
network analysis.
3. Hardware / Software Required: Wireshark.
4. Theory:
Wireshark, a network analysis tool formerly known as Ethereal, captures packets in real time
and display them in human-readable format. Wireshark includes filters, color-coding and other
features that let you dig deep into network traffic and inspect individual packets.
Applications:
•

Network administrators use it to troubleshoot network problems

•

Network security engineers use it to examine security problems

•

Developers use it to debug protocol implementations

•

People use it to learn network protocol internals beside these examples can be helpful
in many other situations too.

As soon as you click the interface‘s name, you‘ll see the packets start to appear in real time.
Wireshark captures each packet sent to or from your system. If you‘re capturing on a wireless
interface and have promiscuous mode enabled in your capture options, you‘ll also see other the
other packets on the network. Wireshark uses colours to help you identify the types of traffic
at a glance. By default, green is TCP traffic, dark blue is DNS traffic, light blue is UDP traffic,
and black identifies TCP packets with problems — for example, they could have been delivered
out-of-order.
Capturing Packets: After downloading and installing wireshark, you can launch it and click the
name of an interface under Interface List to start capturing packets on that interface. For
example, if you want to capture traffic on the wireless network, click your wireless interface.
You can configure advanced features by clicking Capture Options.

Experiment 2: Demonstrate Web penetration testing using BURP
Suite tool.
1. Aim: The aim is to provide a foundation in performing security testing of web applications
using Burp Suite.
2. Objectives: Understand Burp Suite and its tools for web application testing process.
3. Hardware / Software Required: BURP suite tool
4. Theory:
Burp Suite created by PortSwigger Web Security is a Java-based integrated software platform
of tools for performing security testing of web applications. Its various tools work seamlessly
together to support the entire testing process, from initial mapping and analysis of an
application's attack surface, through to finding and exploiting security vulnerabilities. This
includes key components such as: Proxy, Spider, Scanner, Intruder, Repeater and Sequencer.
5. Methodology:
•

Intercepting Proxy

In Burp Suite, intercepting Proxy lets you inspect and modify traffic between your browser and
the target application. Therefore, by using Proxy tab in Burp Suite, we can intercept the
communications between a client (such as a Web browser) and the server. For this, set up your
browser to use a Proxy (127.0.0.1 on port 8080). (Hint: use: Edit > Preferences> Advanced >
Network > Settings).
Go to Burp Suite and in the Proxy tab, set Intercept to on.

Figure 1: BURP suite proxy tab.
Navigate to the http://tutorialsninja (demo web page) home page. Then switch to Burp Suite.
Burp Suite proxy should intercept the request. Click forward. Now, go to your browser and
check if you can see the homepage of tutorialsninja. Now, on the tutorialsninja homepage, click
on Login/Register and go back to Intercept tab on Burp Suite. Right click and select Send to
Intruder (Figure 2)

Brute Force :

we will crack the username and password on the Web login. In this method, capture a sample
login for a user (hint: enter a name and a password in the login page on your browser and press
login) then capture the trace with Burp Suite and send it to Intruder (hint: right click and select:
Send to Intruder).
On Intruder>Positions page, from Attack type drop down menu select: Cluster bomb
Then put fuzzifier around username and password only: $username$, $password$ and clear
the rest of fuzzifiers. Then Go to Intruder>Payloads page and enter the same user names and

Experiment 3: Show Network mapping and port scanning using
Nmap tool.
1. Aim: Use Nmap to scan open ports, perform OS fingerprinting, do a ping scan, tcp port
scan, udp port scan, etc.
2. Objectives: Objective of this module to learn nmap installation & use this to scan
different ports.
3. Hardware / Software Required : NMAP Tool
4.Theory:
Nmap (Network Mapper) is a security scanner originally written by Gordon Lyon (also known
by his pseudonym Fyodor Vaskovich) used to discover hosts and services on a computer
network, thus creating a "map" of the network. To accomplish its goal, Nmap sends specially
crafted packets to the target host and then analyzes the responses. Unlike many simple port
scanners that just send packets at some predefined constant rate, Nmap accounts for the
network conditions (latency fluctuations, network congestion, the target interference with the
scan) during the run. Also, owing to the large and active user community providing feedback
and contributing to its features, Nmap has been able to extend its discovery capabilities beyond
simply figuring out whether a host is up or down and which ports are open and closed; it can
determine the operating system of the target, names and versions of the listening services,
estimated uptime, type of device, and presence of a firewall.
Nmap features include:
•

Host Discovery – Identifying hosts on a network. For example, listing the hosts
which respond to pings or have a particular port open.

•

Port Scanning – Enumerating the open ports on one or more target hosts.

•

Version Detection – Interrogating listening network services listening on
remote devices to determine the application name and version number.

•

OS Detection – Remotely determining the operating system and some hardware
characteristics of network devices.

Dr Shreema Shetty

Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management

14

5. Methodology:
Basic commands working in Nmap
For target specifications:
nmap <target‘s URL or IP with spaces betweenthem>

For OS detection:
nmap -O <target-host's URL orIP>
For version detection:
nmap -sV <target-host's URL orIP>

After the installation of nmap:> sudo apt-get install nmap

SYN scan is the default and most popular scan option for good reasons. It can be
performed quickly, scanning thousands of ports per second on a fast network not
hampered by restrictive firewalls. It is also relatively unobtrusive and stealthy since it never
completes TCP connections.

FIN scan (-sF)
Sets just the TCP FIN bit.

-sV (Version detection) : Enables version detection, as discussed above. Alternatively, we can
use -A, which enables version detection among other things.

-PO protocol list (IP Protocol Ping) :
The newest host discovery option is the IP protocol ping, which sends IP packets with the
specified protocol number set in their IP header. The protocol list takes the same format as do
port lists in the previously discussed TCP, UDP and SCTP host discovery options.

-p port ranges (Only scan specified ports) .
This option specifies which ports you want to scan and overrides the default. Individual port

numbers are OK, as are ranges separated by a hyphen (e.g. 1-1023). The beginning and/or
end values of a range may be omitted, causing Nmap to use 1 and 65535, respectively.

-sO (IP protocol scan) .
IP protocol scan allows you to determine which IP protocols (TCP, ICMP, IGMP, etc.) are
supported by target machines. This isn ́t technically a port scan, since it cycles through IP
protocol numbers rather than TCP or UDP port numbers.
--open (Show only open (or possibly open) ports) .
Sometimes you only care about ports you can actually connect to (open ones), and don ́t want
results cluttered with closed, filtered, and closed|filtered ports.

-p port ranges (Only scan specified ports) .
This option specifies which ports you want to scan and overrides the default. Individual port
numbers are OK, as are ranges separated by a hyphen (e.g. 1-1023). The beginning and/or
end values of a range may be omitted, causing Nmap to use 1 and 65535, respectively.

-sT (TCP connect scan) .
TCP connect scan is the default TCP scan type when SYN scan is not an option. This is the
case when a user does not have raw packet privileges or is scanning IPv6 networks. Instead
of writing raw packets as most other scan types do, Nmap asks the underlying operating
system to establish a connection with the target machine and port by issuing the connect
system call. Along with spoofing.

Null scan (-sN):
Does not set any bits (TCP flag header is 0)

--top-ports <integer of 1 or greater>
Scans the N highest-ratio ports found in nmap-services file.

-PS port list (TCP SYN Ping) .
Dr Shreema Shetty

Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management

16

This option sends an empty TCP packet with the SYN flag set. The default destination port is
80 (configurable at compile time by changing DEFAULT_TCP_PROBE_PORT_SPEC
innmap.h). Alternate ports can be specified as a parameter. The syntax is the same as for the
-p except that port type specifiers like T: are not allowed.

nmap –iflist
host interface and route information with nmap by using ―–iflist‖ option.

6. Conclusion:
Network scanning provides a wealth of information about the target network, which is valuable
regardless of whether you're trying to attack the network or protect it from attack. While
performing a basic scan is a simple matter, the network scanners covered in this experiment
provide a wide array of options to tweak your scan to achieve the best results. Nmap is used to
detect IP spoofing and port scanning.

Experiment 4: Implement a code to simulate buffer overflow
attack.
1. Aim: Implement a code to simulate buffer overflow attack.
2. Objectives: Objective of the module Is to check buffer overflow in an NS2 environment
3. Hardware / Software Required: Stack Guard compiler.
4. Theory:
A buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing
data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations. This
is a special case of the violation of memory safety. A buffer overflow occurs when a program
or process tries to store more data in a buffer (temporary data storage area) than it was intended
to hold.
5. Methodology:
Buffer overflow:
Code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main(void)
{
char buff[15];
int pass = 0;
printf("\n Enter the password : \n");
gets(buff);
if(strcmp(buff, "thecorrectpaswd"))
{
printf ("\n Wrong Password \n");

}
else
{
printf ("\n Correct Password \n");
pass = 1;
}
if(pass)
{
/* Now Give root or admin rights to user*/
printf ("\n Root privileges given to the user \n");
}
return 0;
}

Output :
>>administrator@cyber:~/Desktop/me CS pracs$ gcc -Wall -fno-stack-protector
bufferoverflow.c -o
>>bufferoverflow
The above command deactivates the default GC Compiler's flag which detects Stack
Smashing
>>administrator@cyber:~/Desktop/me CS pracs$ ./bufferoverflow

>>administrator@cyber:~/Desktop/me CS pracs$ ./bufferoverflow
>>Enter the password :
thecorrectpaswd
Correct Password
Root privileges given to the user
administrator@cyber:~/Desktop/me CS pracs$ ./bufferoverflow
Enter the password :
thewrongpasswordentered
Wrong Password
Root privileges given to the user

Here, the entered password length is above the permissible length with wrong contents still
the user is given the ROOT PRIVILEDGES. This demonstrates the Buffer Overflow.

6. Conclusion:
Buffer overflow has been the most exploited vulnerability for more than a decade. Buffer
overflow vulnerabilities are the most common way to gain control of a remote host. Attacker
can insert and execute attack code. Error is made at program creation, is invisible to user.
StackGuard is a systematic compiler tool that prevents a broad class of buffer overflow security
attacks from succeeding.

JCryp tool.
1. Aim: To demonstrate asymmetric, symmetric crypto algorithm using Jcrypt tool.
2. Objectives: To understand Cryptographic algorithm using JCryp tool.
3. Hardware / Software Required: Jcrypt tool software.
4. Theory:
JCrypTool – abbreviated as JCT – is a free e-learning software for classical and modern
cryptology. Cryptology is about techniques and protocols making information available only
for authorized persons.The CrypTool project aims to explain and visualize cryptography and
cryptanalysis in an easy and understandable way while still being correct from a scientific point
of view. Cryptology consists of two parts (fields). The field cryptography: Science of
encryption systems guaranteeing secure and confidential storage and exchange of information
(e.g. between computers). The field cryptanalysis : Cryptanalysis is the counter part to

Experiment 6: Demonstrate Network reconnaissance using
WHOIS tool.
1. Aim: To demonstrate Network reconnaissance using WHOIS tool.
2. Objectives: To know how to gather information about the networks by using network
reconnaissance tools.
3. Hardware / Software Required: WHOIS client
4. Theory:
Reconnaissance is the gathering of information about a target prior to launching an attack. Most
attacks begin by gathering as much information as possible about the target. The whois
databases are a set of tools that can be used for reconnaissance, and are one of the best sets of
tools available. They can be used to get detailed information about a domain, and can help you
gather information about a target. Whois - whois searches for an object in a WHOIS database.
WHOIS is a query and response protocol that is widely used for querying databases that store
the registered users of an Internet resource, such as a domain name or an IP address block, but
is also used for a wider range of other information.
5. Methodology:
The whois command looks up the registration record associated with a domain name. This can
show you more information about who registered and owns a domain name, including their
contact information. Most modern versions of whois try to guess the right server to ask for the
specified object. If no guess can be made, whois will connect to whois.networksolutions.com
for NIC handles or whois.arin.net for IPv4 addresses and network names.
Examples:
• Obtaining the domain WHOIS record for computersolutions.com
• WHOIS record by IP querying
• Querying WHOIS in google search engine
WHOIS is a request and response protocol that follows the RFC 3912 specification. A WHOIS
server listens on TCP port 43 for incoming requests. The domain registrar is responsible for
maintaining the WHOIS records for the domain names it is leasing. The WHOIS server replies
with various information related to the domain requested. Of particular interest, we can learn:

•

Registrar: Via which registrar was the domain name registered?

•

Contact info of registrant: Name, organization, address, phone, among other things.
(unless made hidden via a privacy service)

•

Creation, update, and expiration dates: When was the domain name first registered?
When was it last updated? And when does it need to be renewed?

•

Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve the domain name?

6.Conclusion: In this experiment you learned how to take the first steps toward ethical hacking.
Information gathering, in the form of reconnaissance, foot printing, and social engineering, is
necessary to learn as much about the target as possible. By following the information-gathering
methodology, ethical hackers can ensure they are not missing any steps and valuable
information. Time spent in the information- gathering phase is well worth it to speed up and
produce successful hacking exploits.

Experiment 7: Show how to detect ARP Spoofing using open-source tool
ARPWATCH.
1. Aim: Objective of the module to find ARP spoofing using open source.
2. Objectives: Detect ARP spoofing using open source tool ARPWATCH.
3. Hardware / Software Required: ARPWATCH Tool
4. Theory:
Arpwatch is a tool that monitors Ethernet activity on a network. It is designed to keep track of
Ethernet/IP address pairings (ARP activity) and alert system administrator when any changes
occur. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) is a protocol used to map an IP address to a MAC
address on a local network. Arpwatch is particularly useful for detecting potential network
attacks such as ARP spoofing or MAC address spoofing, which can be used to intercept
network traffic or launch a man-in-the-middle attack.
5. Methodology:
•

Installing Arpwatch

Arpwatch can be installed on most Linux distributions using package manager. On Debianbased systems, you can install it using following command −
$ sudo apt-get install arpwatch
•

Configuring Arpwatch

Once Arpwatch is installed, it needs to be configured before it can start monitoring network
activity. configuration file for Arpwatch is located at /etc/arpwatch.conf.
Here is an example configuration file −
# arpwatch.conf
DEVICE=eth0
# Email address to send alerts to
#EMAIL_ADDRESS=root
eth0 -a -n 192.168.2.1/25
Next install syslog
sudo apt-get install rsyslog

Dr Shreema Shetty
Cyber security Fundamental and Laws
Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management

36

Now enable arpwatch by using following command –
systemctl enable arpwatch@eth0

Then, start Arpwatch service using following command −
sudo service arpwatch start
Arpwatch will now begin monitoring Ethernet activity on specified network interface.
•

Arpwatch Commands and Usage To watch a specific interface, type the following
command with ‗-i‗ and device name.

arpwatch -i eth0
So, whenever a new MAC is plugged or a particular IP is changing his MAC address on the
network, you will notice syslog entries at ‗/var/log/syslog‗ or ‗/var/log/message‗ file.
#tail -f/var/log/syslog
You can also check current ARP table, by using following command.
#arp -a
Sample Output:

ARP Spoofing (Man in Middle attack)
Use the following command to start ARP spoofing
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 192.168.2.3 10.0.2.2
arpspoof -i eth0 -t 10.0.2.2 192.168.2.3
tail -f /var/log/syslog
Use separate terminals to execute these commands and Arpwatch must be enable and started.

Dr Shreema Shetty
Cyber security Fundamental and Laws
Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management

37

The Arpwatch detects any changes in IP address and will be notified in the syslog messages.
The syslog notify ethernet mismatch due to ARP spoofing.

If you want to send alerts to your custom email id, then open the main configuration
file‗/etc/sysconfig/arpwatch‗ and add the email as shown below.

6. Conclusion: Arpwatch is a software or program tool for monitoring Address Resolution
Protocol traffic on a computer network. Its main goal is to detect arp poisoning attacks like
(e.g. ARP Poisoning, Ettercap, and Netcut) also detect intruders in your network by sending an
email to an administrator when new Ethernet MAC addresses seen on the network.

Experiment 8: Demonstrate network vulnerabilities by scanning
network using Nessus tool.
1. Aim: Use the Nessus tool to scan the network for vulnerabilities.
2. Objectives: Objective of the module is scan system and network analysis.
3. Hardware / Software Required: Nessus Vulnerability Scanner | Tenable Network Security
tool.
4. Theory:
Nessus is a proprietary comprehensive vulnerability scanner which is developed by Tenable
Network Security. It is free of charge for personal use in a non-enterprise environment.
Operation
• Nessus allows scans for the following types of vulnerabilities:
• Vulnerabilities that allow a remote hacker to control or access sensitive data on a system.
• Misconfiguration (e.g. open mail relay, missing patches, etc.).
Default passwords, a few common passwords, and blank/absent passwords on some system
accounts. Nessus can also call Hydra (an external tool) to launch a dictionary attack.Denials of
service against the TCP/IP stack by using malformed packets.
5. Methodology:
Preparation for PCI DSS audits
On UNIX (including Mac OS X), it consists of nessusd, the Nessus daemon, which does the
scanning, and nessus, the client, which controls scans and presents the vulnerability results to
the user. In typical operation, Nessus begins by doing a port scan with one of its four internal
port scanners (or it can optionally use AmapM or Nmap) to determine which ports are open on
the target and then tries various exploits on the open ports. The vulnerability tests, available as
subscriptions, are written in NASL(Nessus Attack Scripting Language), a scripting language
optimized for custom network interaction. Tenable Network Security produces several dozen
new vulnerability checks (called plugins) each week, usually on a daily basis. These checks are
available for free to the general public; commercial customers are not allowed to use this Home
Feed any more. The Professional Feed (which is not free) also give access to support and
additional scripts (e.g. audit files, compliance tests, additional vulnerability detection plugins).

Dr Shreema Shetty
Cyber security Fundamental and Laws
Sahyadri College of Engineering and Management

39

Optionally, the results of the scan can be reported in various formats, such as plain text, XML,
HTML and LaTeX. The results can also be saved in a knowledge base for debugging. On
UNIX, scanning can be automated through the use of a command-line client. There exist many
different commercial, free and open source tools for both UNIX and Windows to manage
individual or distributed Nessus scanners. If the user chooses to do so (by disabling the option
'safe checks'), some of Nessus' vulnerability test may try to cause vulnerable services or
operating systems to crash. This lets a user test the resistance of a device before putting it in
production. Nessus provides additional functionality beyond testing for known network
vulnerabilities. For instance, it can use Windows credentials to examine patch levels on
computers running the Windows operating system, and can perform password auditing using
dictionary and brute force methods. Nessus 3 and later can also audit systems to make sure
they have been configured per a specific policy, such as the NSA's guide for hardening
Windows servers.

Running a security scanner against your systems is a very important part of the job. It is a
system administrator or security officer‘s job to keep their systems secure and the data
contained in them safe. Hackers have access to all the same information and tools that the rest
of us do. Hackers run the very same tools and it is advantageous to know what the results are
that they see if they scan your system. They find time to do the research, so we must also.
Nessus provides a lot of functionality in one tool. It utilizes Nmap, easy to update plug-ins, and
nice reporting tools for upper management. It is has repeatedly scored high on comparisons
between scanners including commercial scanners that come with a hefty price tag. And of
course as budgets tighten, remember Nessus is a free tool. The only cost is the users time in
learning it and using it, but that is a cost associated with all tools. Nessus is an easy to learn
tool. Using this tool and seeing the vulnerabilities will help you gain knowledge of your
systems and help teach you how to protect them.

Experiment 9: Demonstrate network testbed Emulab.
1. Aim: Demonstrate and understand network testbed Emulab.
2. Objectives: Understanding Emu test bed setup.
3. Hardware / Software Required: Emulab Test bed.
4. Theory:
Emulab is a testbed that has been developed at the University of Utah since 1999. Emulab
can provide unlimited experimental environments in which researchers can develop, debug
and evaluate their systems. Emulab is also designed for education. Emulab can coordinate a
composite system that includes numerous physical computers as nodes. Each computer has
six network interface cards. The first network interface card manages user logins, power on
signals, power off signals, and other control signals. The other five network interface cards
are connected to a hardware switch. Emulab can manage various virtual local area networks
(VLANs) and connect one or more VLANs to each computer in this system. Each user
navigates to a web interface to request the resources or access the topology of the network.
Emulab allocates all resources within this system.

5.1 Configuring Emulab
An Emulab testbed is easily configured to support operational exercises. This section describes
the steps involved in the design, setup, execution and analysis phases.

1. Design Phase
After determining the participants and developing a detailed scenario, the following
tasks are performed:The network topology is described using an experiment script. The
components (e.g., servers and routers) to be controlled by the participants are
differentiated from the components that simulate the rest of the world (i.e., the context).
The exercise monitoring infrastructure is described and the data collection mechanisms
are configured.
2. Setup Phase
In the setup phase, the predefined systems are instantiated and configured as in any
Emulab experiment. Exercise participants are given access to individual experimental
nodes. Access control mechanisms are used to ensure that participants may only access
the nodes “owned” by them in the scenario. However, exercise moderators are
permitted to access all resources.
3. Execution Phase
During the exercise execution phase, the participants interact with the systems and
among themselves. Their actions are monitored for further analysis after the end of the
exercise (analysis phase). It is important that exercise moderators know how the
exercise is evolving so that they can intervene (e.g., by injecting dynamic events) if
necessary.
4. Analysis Phase
In the analysis phase, the emulation testbed is used to gather recorded data. The data is
used to evaluate the response times, durations of actions, levels of coordination, etc.
The data collected depends on the scope of the exercise.

The topology and related processes of the attack and defense scenario were as shown in Figure
1. In the experiment, a fixed cybersecurity attack and defense scenario was used in an
environment designed for a three-party network.

During the test, participant traffic is directed to the topology through a virtual private network;
the real traffic of the participants is recorded by Netflow Inside Topology (Figure 2). As shown
in Figure 3, the scoreboard displays the current scores of the participants (teams).

6.Conclusion
A platform based on Emulab was demonstrated. This platform was dedicated to training and
experience exchange. The cybersecurity attack and defense exercises provided through this
platform trained the participants regarding the methods, techniques, and mechanisms used in
attack and defense maneuvers.

10. Study of Information Technology Act, 2000 (India)
AMENDMENTS IN IT ACT 2000
The Information Technology Act was enacted in the year 2000 to bring in the necessary
changes for growth of digitalisation and e-commerce transactions, and ensure safety and
security of such transactions, thereby preventing crimes. The act was then amended to
account for the developments in the domain, these amendments were passed by both the
houses of Parliament in 2008 and received President’s assent on 5th February, 2009, thus
becoming the Amendment Act. It introduced various positive developments. It was seen as
an effort by the Government of India to create a policy that is able to maintain pace with
the evolving technology. The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) is
responsible for administration of the Act. The amendment attempted to fill in the gaps left
by the earlier Act, and address the security concerns. The Act was the need of the hour as
with increasing digitalisation, the crimes in the digital space or with the help of digital aids
also proliferated. Sending/sharing offensive content, phishing, identity theft, frauds, etc.
were crimes which had to be brought within the ambit of penal provisions. All these factors
led to the amendments in IT Act 2000, thus paving the way for IT Act 2008. The IT Act
2008 revolutionized the cyber law framework of the nation. The Act addressed various
issues such as incorporating electronic signature, inclusion of greater number of cyber
offences, addressing the concerns pertaining to data protection, privacy, and also dealt with
the issues related to use of digital/cyber medium for terrorism.
The features of The IT Act, 2000 are as follows:
1. The digital signature has been changed to an electronic signature to make it a greater
generation-impartial act.
2. It elaborates on offenses, penalties, and breaches.
3. It outlines the Justice Dispensation Systems for cybercrimes.
4. The Information Technology Act defines in a new segment that a cyber cafe is any
facility wherein access to the net is offered by any person inside the normal business to
the general public.
5. It offers the constitution of the Cyber Regulations Advisory Committee.
